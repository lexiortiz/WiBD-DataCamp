In an HR database, SQL can be used to query salaries for employees in different departments to compare pay across departments.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Best for Large Datasets\n",
        "SQL is often used alongside other tools like spreadsheets to analyze large datasets. It can uncover trends such as website traffic, customer reviews, and product sales. For example, SQL can help identify the best-selling products last week or track changes in website traffic after a feature release.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Keywords\n",
        "SQL uses **keywords** to perform specific operations. The most common keywords are:\n",
        "- **SELECT**: Used to choose which fields to retrieve.\n",
        "- **FROM**: Indicates which table the fields should be selected from.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Selecting Multiple Fields\n",
        "To select multiple fields, list them after the **SELECT** keyword, separated by commas. For example, to select both **card_num** and **name**, we would write:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
