        "- Placing each clause on a new line  \n",

        "Example of a properly formatted query:  \n",

        "To maintain consistency, follow a SQL style guide like Holywell’s, which defines best practices for indentation, capitalization, and naming conventions.\n",

        "#### Semicolon Usage\n",
        "A semicolon (`;`) is not required in PostgreSQL but is considered best practice because:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Some SQL flavors require it.\n",
        "2. It helps when migrating queries between different SQL systems.\n",
        "3. It clearly marks the end of a query, especially in multi-query scripts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",

        "SELECT title FROM films WHERE release_year > 2000;\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Dealing with Non-Standard Field Names\n",
        "Sometimes, field names contain spaces, which is a SQL mistake. To query such fields, use double quotes:\n",

        "```sql\n",
        "SELECT \"release year\" FROM films;\n",
